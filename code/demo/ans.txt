Final Answer: Upon reviewing the question and the solutions provided by the other agents, I can confirm that the recognition of the word "starting" and the steps outlined are indeed correct in demonstrating the breakdown of letters into valid words. 

Let me examine the steps once again in detail:

1. **starting** (original word, 8 letters)
2. **staring** (remove 't', 7 letters)
3. **string** (remove 'a', 6 letters)
4. **sting** (remove 'r', 5 letters)
5. **sing** (remove 't', 4 letters)
6. **sin** (remove 'g', 3 letters)
7. **in** (remove 's', 2 letters)
8. **I** (remove 'n', 1 letter)

All of these transformations yield words that are indeed proper English words, which validates that "starting" is a legitimate answer for the riddle posed.

Given this consistency among the responses from the other agents, I would assign the following scores, focusing on their accuracy and clarity while noting that they all essentially repeat the same information:

1. **Agent response 1:** 5 (Comprehensive and clear breakdown)
2. **Agent response 2:** 5 (Accurate repetition of the correct information)
3. **Agent response 3:** 5 (Accurate and clear, albeit similar to others)
4. **Agent response 4:** 5 (Also correct and clearly articulated)

Since the agents all correctly identified "starting" and provided accurate breakdowns, their responses deserve full scores. 

Here¡¯s the final score summary: **[[5, 5, 5, 5]]**. 

Thus, my conclusion is that "starting" is indeed the correct answer, and all other agents correctly answered the question with no errors in their logical breakdown.

Agent Importance Scores: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5]
